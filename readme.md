# Autostaker Browser Extension

Autostaker is a mirror protocol automatic re-staker chrome extension. Mirror protocol short pools typically require a manual collecting selling for 50/50 with UST and restaking. This extension simplifies all of those steps and lets you compound those gains with a single button!

The extension re-implements the standalone autostaker from [Autostaker by YunSuk Yeo](https://github.com/YunSuk-Yeo/autostaker) and makes it accesible to those whom don't know how to program.
